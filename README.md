# mobileApp
This repository is about mobileApp POC using a public Api. The goal for this app is to get a list of products from a Public Api and then you will be able to know more information about the product choosen from the list of product.

#Main characteristics
This proyect uses a couple of 3Â° parties app. One is Retrofit library, it will allow us getting information from public API. Also we have a Picasso library to show the image of product obtained, in the different places we need show product images.
About the architecture it is implemented with MVP pattern. This approach is similar to MVC, the idea is to divide the app in several layers (Model, View and Controller), that kind of independency allow you to reduce the impact on your app in case of some change in each one of those layer.
